# zip--unzip--files-with-HUFFMANN-encoding-with-User-defined-number-of-threads
## A complete zip and unzip functions for files using HUFFMAN encoding!
Here the **zip** function effectively saves the zipped file in **Binary format**.
This code also allows the user to **select the number of threads**!
It effectively uses the required amount of **dynamic memory and frees the threads and the memory after its completions**!
Hence, **minimizing memory leaks and making it ThreadSafe**!
